        <h1>Privacy Policy for "Criminal Cooperation"</h1>
        <span class="date">Last Updated: January 5, 2026</span>

        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Stefano Gambarin</strong> ("we", "us") handles user data in the video game "Criminal Cooperation". We are committed to transparency regarding the limited technical data processed to enable multiplayer features.</p>

        <h2>1. How Data is Captured</h2>
        <p>We do not require you to create a proprietary account with us, nor do we use forms to collect personal information manually. Data is captured automatically through the <strong>Epic Online Services (EOS)</strong> SDK integration when you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Launch the application and authenticate using your existing Epic Games account.</li>
            <li>Initiate or join a multiplayer session (Lobby).</li>
            <li>Interact with other players via the in-game networking system.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How Data is Used</h2>
        <p>We process specific technical data solely to provide the game's core functionality. Specifically:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Your <em>Epic Account ID</em> is used to verify your identity with Epic Games servers, ensuring you are a legitimate user.</li>
            <li><strong>Matchmaking & Invites:</strong> Your <em>Product User ID</em> and <em>Online Presence</em> status are used to allow you to send/receive game invites and find your friends' lobbies.</li>
            <li><strong>Peer-to-Peer Connectivity:</strong> Your <em>IP Address</em> is processed transiently to establish a direct network connection between you and the other player (Agent vs Hacker). This is necessary to synchronize game state (position, actions) in real-time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How Data is Shared</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your data with advertisers or third-party data brokers. Data sharing is strictly limited to technical necessities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>With Epic Games:</strong> Authentication data is exchanged directly between your game client and Epic Games, Inc. to facilitate login. This is subject to <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/privacypolicy" target="_blank">Epic Games' Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>With Other Players (P2P):</strong> Because this game uses Peer-to-Peer networking, your IP address may be visible to the specific player you are connected with during a match. This is a fundamental requirement of P2P architecture.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. How Data is Retained</h2>
        <p><strong>We do not retain your personal data.</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not maintain a backend database of user profiles, gameplay history, or chat logs.</li>
            <li>All data processing described above occurs in the computer's Random Access Memory (RAM) or on the Epic Games servers.</li>
            <li>Once you close the game application or terminate the session, any local temporary data regarding the session is discarded.</li>
            <li>Save files (game progress) are stored locally on your own hard drive and are not uploaded to us.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Contact Information</h2>
        <p>If you have questions about this policy or the technical handling of your data, please contact:</p>
        <p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:privacy@stefanogambarin.it">privacy@stefanogambarin.it</a></p>
